#+title: Cursor theme

Check path of icon archives (if it's still same as in [[file:unpack-all.sh]]) and
run it. To make custom cursor theme work and not revert back to default
/usr/share/icons/Adwaita i removed the latter.

To *change* cursor theme you need to change it's name in 3 places:
- [[file:~/dotfiles/.config/hypr/autorun.sh]]
- [[file:default/index.theme]]
- [[file:~/dotfiles/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini]]

*NOTE*: cursor theme is name of its folder in =~/.icons=

Already *installed* cursor themes can be viewed with the command:

: find /usr/share/icons ~/.local/share/icons ~/.icons -type d -name "cursors"

No lxappearance needed, i just need cursor theme..

Sources, but those ain't much needed with the explanation above: [[https://wiki.hyprland.org/FAQ/#how-do-i-change-me-mouse-cursor][hyprland wiki
