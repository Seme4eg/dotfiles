My quick 'research' when picking up keys for gpg keys:
1. [[https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/155774/what-is-the-most-robust-available-algo-for-gpg-symmetric-encryption][what is most sequre algo at 2024]]
2. [[https://preyproject.com/blog/types-of-encryption-symmetric-or-asymmetric-rsa-or-aes#aes-vs-rsa-understanding-the-key-differences][difference between rsa and aes]] - former is when you need to exchange public
   key, latter is symmetric, means no exchanging
3. meanwhile found [[https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices][gpg bestpractises]] and there at the bottom [[https://github.com/ioerror/duraconf/blob/master/configs/gnupg/gpg.conf][github link]] to
   duraconf repo.
4. while [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/723376/how-to-specify-aes-256-algorithm-when-creating-gpg-key][trying to figure out how to generate AES gpg key]] (without public one)
   got onto [[https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/67314][some]] [[https://security.stackexchange.com/a/50890/281475][links]] that showed me that i should rather use curve algo.
   Specifically 'Curve25519'
5. Result: ~gpg --full-generate-key --expert~ -> then all defaults + huge enthropy
   passphrase
