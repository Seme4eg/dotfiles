** Bootstrapping
The list below is my personall fresh install process. Check targets in Makefile
and adjust to your needs.

- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seme4eg/dotfiles/master/Makefile
- ~make ssh~ -> add ssh pub key that's stored in printed 0x0 link to github
- import all gpg keys you need
- ~make install~
- ~make postinstall~
- reboot, wait for the internet, login, launch hyprland, ~make postreboot~
- setup [[*gpg][gpg]]
- also _DO_ check targets in makefile that need to be run manually
- clone secrets into ~/git/secrets repo, not in HOME dir

** Some bloatware i install whenever i need
- _okular_ for signing pdfs, for now still searching for more lightweight solution
  cuz it pulls like 60 packages along with it
- _font-manager_ - whenever i need to mess with fonts in my system, whether its
  status bar styling or anything else
** Todos
*** When will be installing new system -
- rename ~/git to ~/repos, makes more sence, adjust all the paths and move
  dotfiles repo there as well, make an alias that will prevent you from
  mindlessly running 'stow .' and pollute your ~/repos dir cuz you ran it in
  ~/repos/dotfiles.

*** IDEA maybe make some 5/6th workspace a scratchpad and fill it with useful widgets?
