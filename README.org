** Bootstrapping
The list below is my personall fresh install process. Check targets in Makefile
and adjust to your needs.

- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seme4eg/dotfiles/master/Makefile
- ~make ssh~ -> add ssh pub key that's stored in printed 0x0 link to github
- ~make install~
- ~make asus/xiaomi~
- ~make postinstall~
- reboot, wait 5 secs for internet, login, launch hyprland, ~make postreboot~
- also check some of the targets in makefile that need/can be run manually

** Todos
*** IDEA try/switch to [[https://github.com/Aylur/ags][ags]]
*** IDEA maybe make some 5/6th workspace a scratchpad and fill it with useful widgets?
