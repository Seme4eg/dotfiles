** Bootstrapping
For now stow symlinks work fine for me, but if it's a fresh install - create
$HOME/.local/share first, otherwise steam and other apps quickly flood it and my
emacs project indexing rips. Also i'd create $HOME/.local/bin. Then just ~stow .~

** Notes
i have 2 machines but they configs don't differ that much to use somethings like
shezmoi. But they do have different resolution for hyprland and id for
syncthing.

So i've just updated git index to 'untrack' files that differ and don't change.

: git update-index --assume-unchanged ./.config/syncthing/config.xml ./.config/hypr/scale.conf

To get any of those files 'back on track':

: git update-index --no-assume-unchanged {files}

*** rofi
scripts that might be useful later:
- https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass
- aur/rofi-mpd-git - A Rofi menu for interacting with MPD written in Python.
- aur/rofi-mpc - Fast graphical Rofi-Interface for controlling MPD

** Todos [0/3]
*** TODO animate eww somewhere?
idk yet, eww animations are glitchy
*** TODO fix eww trashing logs when no network (and its nonet-slowdowns)
