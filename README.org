#+title: dots never come to a dot..

** How it looks
- Compositor:Hyprland
- App launcher:rofi
- Status bar:eww
- Screen locker:swaylock-effects
- Theme changing:pywal
- Notifications:mako
- Terminal:Alacritty

[[https://youtu.be/-y-OE9myZqw][Youtube demo]] where i show mostly theming and not much more, but hyprland is
capable of many more nice-looking things, most of which i have on keybindings
and use heavily, but didn't show cuz otherwise it would make vid too long.

Some screenshots:

** Bootstrapping
For now stow symlinks work fine for me, but if it's a fresh install - create
~/.local/share first, otherwise steam and other apps quickly flood it and my
emacs project indexing rips. Then just ~stow .~

** Notes
i have 2 machines but they configs don't differ that much to use somethings like
shezmoi. But they do have different resolution for hyprland and id for
syncthing.

So i've just updated git index to 'untrack' files that differ and don't change.

: git update-index --assume-unchanged ./.config/mako/config ./.config/syncthing/config.xml ./.config/hypr/scale.conf

To get any of those files 'back on track':

: git update-index --no-assume-unchanged {files}

*** rofi
scripts that might be useful later:
- https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass
- aur/rofi-mpd-git - A Rofi menu for interacting with MPD written in Python.
- aur/rofi-mpc - Fast graphical Rofi-Interface for controlling MPD
