** Bootstrapping
The list below is my personall fresh install process. Check targets in Makefile
and adjust to your needs.

- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seme4eg/dotfiles/master/Makefile
- ~make ssh~ -> add ssh pub key that's stored in printed 0x0 link to github
- ~make install~
- ~make asus/xiaomi~
- ~make postinstall~
- reboot, wait 5 secs for internet, login, launch hyprland, ~make postreboot~
- also check some of the targets in makefile that need/can be run manually

** Notes
Maybe useful rofi scripts:
- https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass
- aur/rofi-mpd-git - A Rofi menu for interacting with MPD written in Python.
- aur/rofi-mpc - Fast graphical Rofi-Interface for controlling MPD
