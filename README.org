** Bootstrapping
*NOTE:* currently borked 100%, didn't test after migrated off Makefile.

The list below is my personall fresh install process. Check targets in Makefile
and adjust to your needs.

- XXX? ssh needed to clone dotfiles ?

#+begin_src sh
export SSHDIR=${HOME}/.$@
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm open$@
mkdir -p $SSHDIR
ssh-keygen -C "for github"
# create AUR keypair
ssh-keygen -f $SSHDIR/aur
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add $SSHDIR/id_ed25519
chmod 600 $SSHDIR/id_ed25519
curl -F 'file=@-' 0x0.st <$SSHDIR/id_ed25519.pub
#+end_src

- clone that repo into =~/dotfiles=
- XXX? ~make ssh~ -> add ssh pub key that's stored in printed 0x0 link to github
- import all gpg keys you need (see /docs/arch)
- run =~/dotfiles/install.sh= script
- also _DO_ check targets in makefile that need to be run manually
- clone secrets into ~/git/secrets repo, not in HOME dir

** Some bloatware i install whenever i need
- _okular_ for signing pdfs, for now still searching for more lightweight solution
  cuz it pulls like 60 packages along with it
- _font-manager_ - whenever i need to mess with fonts in my system, whether its
  status bar styling or anything else

** TUIs to keep in mind
For now don't need them but maybe some day idk
- Hyprland Monitor Settings - hyprmon
- TUI AI - crush (by Charm)
- Discord - Equibob | Theme System24.
- Docker - lazydocker

** Todos
*** add uwf firewall (see omarchy)
*** migrate to limine & btrfs (see omarchy)
see for '.*limine.*' files and 'limine' entries in omarchy repo
*** When will be installing new system
- rename ~/git to ~/repos, makes more sence, adjust all the paths and move
  dotfiles repo there as well, make an alias that will prevent you from
  mindlessly running 'stow .' and pollute your ~/repos dir cuz you ran it in
  ~/repos/dotfiles.

*** IDEA maybe make some 5/6th workspace a scratchpad and fill it with useful widgets?
