#+title: dots never come to a dot..

** TODO 'How it looks' section + what's used
** TODO Bootstrapping
** Notes
i have 2 machines but they configs don't differ that much to use somethings like
shezmoi. But they do have different resolution for hyprland and id for
syncthing.

So i've just updated git index to 'untrack' files that differ and don't change.

: git update-index --assume-unchanged ./.config/mako/config ./.config/syncthing/config.xml ./config/hypr/scale.conf

To get any of those files 'back on track':

: git update-index --no-assume-unchanged {files}

*** rofi
scripts that might be useful later:
- https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass
- aur/rofi-mpd-git - A Rofi menu for interacting with MPD written in Python.
- aur/rofi-mpc - Fast graphical Rofi-Interface for controlling MPD
