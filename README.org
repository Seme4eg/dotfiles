** Bootstrapping
For now stow symlinks work fine for me, but if it's a fresh install - create
$HOME/.local/share first, otherwise steam and other apps quickly flood it and my
emacs project indexing rips. Also i'd create $HOME/.local/bin. Then just ~stow .~

** Notes
i have 2 machines but they configs don't differ that much to use somethings like
shezmoi. But they do have different resolution for hyprland and id for
syncthing.

So i've just updated git index to 'untrack' files that differ and don't change.

: git update-index --assume-unchanged ./.config/syncthing/config.xml ./.config/hypr/scale.conf

To get any of those files 'back on track':

: git update-index --no-assume-unchanged {files}

*** rofi
scripts that might be useful later:

- aur/rofi-mpd-git - A Rofi menu for interacting with MPD written in Python.
- aur/rofi-mpc - Fast graphical Rofi-Interface for controlling MPD

** Todos [0/1]
*** IDEA migrate from pacman hooks to Makefile
on next fresh install don't autoinstall all packages from pkg files, do
everything by hand and via makefile targets. Do not remove hooks, just don't
commit the change without a Makefile target. Reason - things will be more
organized and instead of blaming to see why i installed something i will see it
in makefile target.
