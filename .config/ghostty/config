# This is the configuration file for Ghostty.
#
# Run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# Ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: Command + Shift + comma on macOS and
# Control + Shift + comma on other platforms). Not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect.

# # Spacing around the equals sign does not matter.
#
# # Any line beginning with a # is a comment. It's not possible to put
# # a comment after a config option.
#
# # Empty values are used to reset config keys to default.
