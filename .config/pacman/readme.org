Read [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman/Tips_and_tricks#List_of_installed_packages][list of installed packages]] and sections below to install backups.

To setup hooks in =hooks= *set* its' directory to ~HookDir~ in =pacman.conf=, beware
tho, there is no way to specify multiple directories in .conf file, i tried and
it deleted all my preinstalled with artix hooks, that were in
=/etc/pacman.d/hooks/=  dir... So just specify single path and *move* there all
hooks from previous one.

#+NAME: in pacman.conf
: HookDir     = $HOME/.config/pacman/hooks/

*NOTEs*:
- '$HOME' might not be known to pacman so you might need to explicitly state
  your user home dir
- don't forget to check username and path in those hooks in case you changed any
  of those

To improve download speeds [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#Enabling_parallel_downloads][enable]] parallel downloads and use [[https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=RU&protocol=https&ip_version=4&ip_version=7][pacman mirrorlist
generator]] to get links relevant for your location.

And maybe ya'll want 'Color' option uncommented in =pacman.conf=.
