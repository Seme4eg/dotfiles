#+title: Readme

- Important references: [[https://aylur.github.io/ags-docs/][great ags wiki]] is the way, just learn to read.
- For which *fonts* are used in this config just search this dir recursively. Cuz
  i might be changing those from time to time and maintaining precise list of
  fonts in this readme will be tedious. The only font to stay for sure is the
  one for icons - any nerd font. I use 'daddytimemono nerd font'.
- *Dependencies*: /pacman-contrib/ for ~checkupdates~. The rest are required by ags
  services: /pipewire-pulse/, /upower/, /gnome-bluetooth-3.0/ (and experimental
  enabled in bluetooth config), /network-manager/, /power-profiles-damon/,
  /libdbusmenu-gtk3/.
- How to *collapse*, *reveal*, *expand* and such - help is [[https://github.com/druskus20/eugh][here]], yes, example is for
  eww, but ez to rewrite on ags

** Todos
*** TODO use Widget.Stack() for mpris widget and maybe notifications list
*** TODO listen on 'monitor-add/remove' signals on hyprland service
.. and change the monitor on which the bar appears.

Basically same functionality as eww-window-manager service and eww-manager
script were doing.
*** TODO mpris widget double line, maybe small icon of playing track
... and setup method to show actual status right after bar reload

*** TODO NOTIFICATIONS
**** TODO [#B] setup a notifications module test function
similar to this
#+begin_src sh
# [body] markup:
# https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/latest/ar01s04.html
# -u critical
# -t 5000
notify-send "Test noicon notification" "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas ut mauris quis ante bibendum ..."
say "Test normal notification. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas ut mauris quis ante bibendum ..."
say -u critical "Test critical notification. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas ut mauris quis ante bibendum ..."
#+end_src
**** TODO finish no notifications widget in notifications list
**** TODO use scroll widget with notification windows
**** TODO when clearing notifications the don't get cleared all at once
.. but rather one by one, which might be annoying if many
*** TODO power-profiles widget
*** TODO yoink the wallpaper widget from [[https://github.com/qxb3/gruvbox.hypr/tree/vim_styled/.config/ags][this guy]], reskin
*** TODO check other TODO occurances in ags dir

*** TODO make heavy usage of ags signals. Later will see which ones i don't need
but for now try as many of them as possible
