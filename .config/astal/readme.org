- For which *fonts* are used in this config just search this dir recursively. Cuz
  i might be changing those from time to time and maintaining precise list of
  fonts in this readme will be tedious. The only font to stay for sure is the
  one for icons - any nerd font. I use 'daddytimemono nerd font'.
- *Dependencies*: /pacman-contrib/ for ~checkupdates~. The rest are required by ags
  services: /pipewire-pulse/, /upower/, /gnome-bluetooth-3.0/ (and experimental
  enabled in bluetooth config), /network-manager/, /libdbusmenu-gtk3/.
- How to *collapse*, *reveal*, *expand* and such - help is [[https://github.com/druskus20/eugh][here]], yes, example is for
  eww, but ez to rewrite on ags

** Todos
*** TODO listen on 'monitor-add/remove' signals on hyprland service
.. and change the monitor on which the bar appears.

Basically same functionality as eww-window-manager service and eww-manager
script were doing.
