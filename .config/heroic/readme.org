#+title: Long time this file should've appeared

- _Controller_ doesn't work? - PROTON_PREFER_SDL=1
  - if still doesn't work - close heroic and launch this game from steam WITH
    steam input. If heroic is opened - won't work. NO need to change proton
    version from GE to steam one,
- Adding _friends_:
  - In settings -> advanced -> EOS Overlay section -> install
  - go to game page from your library, in burger menu find option 'Enable EOS
    Overlay', when game launches you will get a login overlay, login and from it
    add friends
- do NOT disable setting 'automatically add new games to steam' as there might
  be games where controller doesn't work if you don't start game from within
  steam. And adding games manually is a pain.
- how to make cheatengine work on games:
  - download .exe cheatengine file
  - use 'run exe on prefix' in game you need
- how to start _cheatengine_ in same prefix as the game:
  - download cheatengine
  - in game settings in heroic do 'run exe on prefix', choose that cheatengine
    exe file, install it
  - download needed .ct file, put it under the path
    =/home/earthian/.local/share/Games/Heroic/Prefixes/default/<game>/drive_c/Program
    Files/Cheat Engine/<file>.CT= (example)
  - create a .bat executable file in
    =/home/earthian/.local/share/Games/Heroic/<game>/fix.bat= or whichever game
    you need
#+begin_src bat
:: start /B "null" "C:\Program Files\Cheat Engine\Cheat Engine.exe"
start /B "null" "C:\Program Files\Cheat Engine\<file>.CT"

ping -n 20 localhost > nul

<game>.exe %*
#+end_src
  - set that .bat file in 'advanced' settings tab as 'alternative EXE to run'.
