** *networking*
rfkill unblock wifi
ip link set wlan0 up

[[https://youtu.be/DPLnBPM4DhI?t=719][This vid]] info:
- Make sure we have internet connection: ~ip addr show~ (or just ~ip a~). There
  ya'll c your wireless connection as =wlan0= or something.
- To connect to wi-fi type ~iwctl~, then if u don't know your wireless device name
  run ~device list~.
- Find the wi-fi - ~station {wireless_device_name} scan~, which won't show
  anything, but will initiate the scan.
- Get networks - ~station {wireless_device_name} get-networks~
- connect - ~station {device_name} connect {wifiname}~. After that your ~ip a~
  should give wlan ip.

- s6-rc-bundle add default NetworkManager
- ~s6-rc -u change NetworkManager~
- ~sudo nmtui~
- ~touch /etc/s6/adminsv/default/contents.d/NetworkManager~
** hwclock --systohc
** *Enable arch repos*
- [[https://wiki.artixlinux.org/Main/Repositories#Arch_repositories][arch repos]]
- run ~pacman-key --populate archlinux~ (which should b suggested to run after
  package installation).
- edit arch mirrorlist -> vim ~/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist-arch -> uncomment your
  country mirrors
** audio
- _audio_: alsa-utils alsa-utils-s6
- enable alsa service
** all the rest of postinstallation
=openssh= & =openssh-s6= - to generage ssh for github

... and also gives the ability to manage installation remotely. If you do enable
that figure out how to make it start when your computer starts (with systemd u
jus need to run ~systemctl enable sshd~, but i ain't usin it). Next steps r
optional, but in case you want to connect to your machine via ssh from another
one: ~rc-update add sshd default~


** Notes
- ~grep <username> /etc/group~ will give you which groups user already is in

** s6 problems
- *suspend / hybernation*:
- /etc/elogind/logind.conf <- tried
- acpid + acpid-s6 + enabling its service doesn't help (+ logind handles
    hardware switches like lid events OOTB)

  - adding [[https://github.com/elogind/elogind/issues/140#issuecomment-710511939][this]] script didn't help as well, first added separate file in
    system-sleep dir, than replaced original 'nvidia' file contents.. didn't
    help
  - *!* [[https://forum.artixlinux.org/index.php/topic,1639.msg11220.html#msg11220][artix linux forum thread]] <- maybe here is a trace
  - [[https://forum.artixlinux.org/index.php/topic,3599.msg23379.html#msg23379][this thread]] describes my problem, except i can't `cat mem >|
    /sys/power/state` even as sudo, permission denied
** Todos
- learn s6, by starting from [[https://skarnet.org/software/s6/why.html][this]] and [[https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1105854.html][this]] article; write service that will
  'updatedb' every hour
  - move some things to user services from [[file:.config/hypr/autorun.sh][autorun]]
